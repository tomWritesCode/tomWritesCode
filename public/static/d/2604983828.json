This should cover the website that took forever to build. \n\nSo, tomWritesCode, a site to house my blog, and just some basic stuff about me. It only took what felt like 300 years to make, a series of pushbacks due to other things I wanted to make and the constant learning of new things which makes more revisions etc, etc, (I'm sure that if you have ever made your own site you will know the feeling.)\n\n\n\n"}}}]}}}
