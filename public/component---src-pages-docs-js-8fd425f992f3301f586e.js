My favorite roast they have is called Raspberry Candy and I have had way too many of those while at that cafe.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1550563515/Screenshot2.png\\" alt=\\"raspberryCandy Theme\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>raspberryCandy NodeJS Web Scraper</h2>\\n<p>After making the raspberryCandy VS Code theme, I had and still have the huge novelty of checking daily to see how many downloads it has.</p>\\n<p>As a little side project I wanted to learn how to make a Node CLI tool and decided to roll that want with a way to check the downloads of my theme. </p>\\n<p>I found a tutorial that went through making a web scraper and adapted it to use the VS Code Marketplace page of raspberryCandy, find the styling tag of the number of downloads and then pull the text from it. </p>\\n<p>Then using Chalk, Figlet, Request Promise and Cheerio I would return the result to the terminal as well as a small math calculation which worked out how many days the theme has been released. I then added the command \'raspberry\' to the project so that the command can be run straight from my terminal from any directory. </p>\\n<p>A small project that only really has relevance for me but gave me a great understanding of working in a small NodeJS environment and making a CLI tool. </p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1555478402/Screen_Shot_2019-04-17_at_8.43.53_am.png\\" alt=\\"raspberryCandy Web Scraper\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Basketball NoStarz - <a href=\\"https://no-starz.tomwritescode.now.sh/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Check out the project</a></h2>\\n<p> I have been playing basketball with my brother on my my days off and wanted a way to track our scores, that night this project started.</p>\\n<p> The original concept was a quick Gatsby knock up to make sure it worked. Once I worked out the base way of how I wanted to do it I decided to use NextJS, Emotion, Zeit\'s Now hosting platform to build it.</p>\\n<p> The main part of the project uses a lot of state and I plan to start learning and using Redux now that I have the concept of the project running and usable, among this there is also a large list of things I would like to work on and add to the project.</p>\\n<p> For me this is a really awesome project that constantly has room to grow and add new ideas and features really giving me a great platform to have as a constantly growing app.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1555541786/nostarz.gif\\" alt=\\"Basketball NoStarz\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Bit Rates Are Us - <a href=\\"https://bitratesareus.netlify.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Check out the project</a></h2>\\n<p>This is a calculator I use to workout how much storage a given framerate should take up when shooting on my Blackmagic Pocket 4K video camera.</p>\\n<p>This project is built using Vanilla JS and simple HTML and CSS. The main weight of the project is working with the different bitrates and recording formats/codecs and then displaying them on the page.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1580122610/Blackmagic_Calculator.gif\\" alt=\\"Blackmagic Calculator\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>dadJokes() - <a href=\\"https://jokesfromyourdad.netlify.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Check out the project</a></h2>\\n<p>This doesn\'t need to exist, but here it is anyway. There was a running joke at the Code Heart Design Conference that we needed dad jokes in between the silence of people switching laptops. This was made the very next day.</p>\\n<p>Built in Gatsby because that is what I always reach for when I want to make something quickly.</p>\\n<p>The main logic behind it working is the array of objects in JokeList.js:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070086/dadJokes.png\\" alt=\\"dadJokes\\"></p>\\n<p>This is then used by the JokeGenerator.js file when someone presses the \'Just one more.\' button which triggers the NewJoke() function:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070086/dadJoke_Generator.png\\" alt=\\"newJoke\\"></p>\\n<p>The JokeGenerator function runs first which generates a random Integer based on how long the array of jokes is.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070085/dadJoke_Numbers.png\\" alt=\\"randomNumber\\"></p>\\n<p>Once that has been done the selected joke is then set into the joke and punchline sections of the page.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>tomWritesCode - <a href=\\"https://github.com/tomWritesCode/tomWritesCode\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Check out the codebase</a></h2>\\n<p>This site is built in Gatsby, but as well as React and GraphQL being packaged with Gatsby I am also using Styled Components as well as Emotion because I wanted to see how it worked.
