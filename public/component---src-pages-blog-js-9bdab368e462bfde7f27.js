The extension of the standard request promise.*\\n  \\n__- Cheerio -__ *Helps to traverse the DOM letting us select parts of the page we would like to extract.*\\n\\n---\\n\\nFiglet is a great package for making ASCII art from text and has a library of different ways to do so. Chalk is used to colour the text of the response in the terminal which means I could keep the raspberryCandy colours being returned. \\n\\nThe first part of my code is making the piece that looks after displaying when raspberryCandy was released and how many days it has been released for which sits below the number of downloads in the command line result. To do this all I used was the Date function built into Javascript, making one of the dates the release which I already knew and wasnt going to change just put it straight in. And then another date which is the date and time that the function is called.\\n\\n![dates](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070897/dates.png)\\n\\nFollowing that I made a function which calculates how many days raspberryCandy has been out. The function works in two steps, firslty it subtracts the release date from the current date which then gives us the amount of time bwtween the dates but in Milliseconds (which isn\'t the most readable).\\n\\n![dateDifference](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070896/dateDiff.png)\\n\\nStep two of the function takes the result in milliseconds and divides it by the math that converts milliseconds to days. This is wrapped in a Math.round() function to give whole days as a return without a decimal.\\n\\n\\n![dateDifference Full](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070895/dateDifference.png)\\n\\nNow for the main party trick, scraping the marketplace page for raspberryCandy to get the number of downloads. This is where we use the request-promise package and give it the target url which in this case is the page on the Visual Studio Marketplace.\\n\\nInspecting the page prior to building this I found that the piece I was after was a span with the class name \'downloads-text\'. Using Cheerio I can target the span with the right class name from the HTML document and then return it as plain text. Below I have laid out the basic structure of what it is doing. \\n\\n![requestPromise](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070897/requestPromise.png)\\n\\nNow that we have the heavy lifting out of the way the structure comes into play. In my example I have wrapped each of the console.log() returns with the Chalk package allowing me to set the colour, in this case I am going with the Purple and Aqua colours of raspberryCandy.\\n\\n![consoleLog Small](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070897/consoleLog.png)\\n\\nThe other extra piece is using Figlet which gives me the ASCII art, this wraps around the Cherrio function and takes the properties of what font to use, as well as the horizontal and vertical layouts. \\n\\n![consoleLong](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070894/consoleLog_Long.png)\\n\\nNow that it\'s all pieced together the last thing left to do was to link it to my terminal as a single command rather than having to go to the file system and run the JS file. To do this, we add a line to the top of the file which will let us add our command to the package.json.\\n\\n![bin](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070895/bin.png)\\n\\nThis line will let it be triggered as a Node command and run. This will also let the next part we add to the package.json work. Inside the package.json I have added:\\n\\n![binCommand](https://res.cloudinary.com/tomwritescode/image/upload/v1560070895/binCommand.png)\\n\\nFinal step is to run *__npm link__* in the terminal while in the folder. This takes the bin command, in this case *__\\"raspberry\\"__* and then launches the command *__\\"./raspberryScraper.js\\"__*. This is similar to any short hand command like *__npm run start__* or *__gatsby develop__*.\\n\\n___\\n\\n## Links\\n\\n### - [__Scotch.io article I got most of the resources from.__](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js \\"Scotch.io Article\\")\\n### - [__request-promise GitHub page__](https://github.com/request/request-promise \\"request-promise GitHub Page\\")\\n### - [__Cheerio GitHub page__](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio \\"Cheerio GitHub Page\\")\\n### - [__Figlet NPM page__](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet \\"Figlet NPM Page\\")\\n### - [__My GitHub page of the scraper__](https://github.com/tomWritesCode/raspberryScraper \\"tomWritesCode GitHub source code\\")\\n"}}},{"node":{"intro":"raspberryCandy has been a project running in the background for about 2 months now.
